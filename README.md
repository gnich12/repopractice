## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo by running `git clone` command in your terminal with the URL from your repo. 
It should look something like this: 
`git clone https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v8-geckos-team-11.git`

This URL above is also referred as `origin` on your local machine. 


# Git Workflow

1. From inside your local directory, git the branches and their commits from origin:
`git fetch origin`

2. Merge the changes from `origin/dev` to your local branch:
`git merge origin/dev`

Now you are ready to make your own changes!

3. Create a separete branch: `git checkout -b <branch name/short-description>

**Naming branches**
Name branches by type (**bug**, **feature**, **refactor**, or **style**) followed by a short description.  
Examples of branch names via [@Kornil](https://medium.com/@francesco.agnoletto/how-to-not-f-up-your-local-files-with-git-part-1-e0756c88fd3c):
 - bug/fixed-all-caps
 - feature/giant-duck-modal
 - refactor/add-prop-types
 - style/everything-is-black
 
 4. Save and commit stage changes:
   a. stage new files and modification
   `git add .` Stage all new/modified/deleted files
       or
   `git add <file name>` stage a specific file that was created/modified/deleted
  
   b. commit new files:
   commit message should be atomic and written in atomic mood(like giving an order)
   `git commit -m <message here>`
   
   Example of commit message via: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#imperative
   `git commit -m "update getting started documentation"
   
 4. Once you have save and commit your change, fetch the latest code again:
